# 👋 Hi, I'm [Teun]

Welcome to my project portfolio!

I am a graduating Data Science student, in the past years, I have worked on many projects. Below are a few of them!

## 🛠️ Projects

- **[Group Project](https://github.com/TessaDerks/Putting-group_09)**  
  As a group, we created a simulator of a golfing game. This was one of the most fun projects I have worked on during my studies. We ended up making a maze and AI that can play through the maze.
  The basis for this agent was a genetic algorithm. 
  
- **[Poker Knowledge Graphs](https://github.com/teunhermans/Poker_KG)**  
  I have used two datasets to create a knowledge graph with knowledge about the game of poker. SQL queries retrieve information about this KG.

- **[Bachelor Thesis](https://github.com/teunhermans/Thesis-code)**  
  For my bachelor thesis I experimented with a concept from optimisation, the integrality gap. This is the ratio of the relaxation of the optimization problem.
  I have experimented with this in Python, specifically with the Gurobi Library.

- **Agents in a MountainCarEnviroment**  
  Tested various agents in the classic mountaincar enviroment.  

- **Q-Learning on blackjack enviroment**  
  Among others, a Q learning agent to learn BlackJack.  

- **MultiAgent Learning**  
  Using Connect-Four to test MultiAgent Learning.
