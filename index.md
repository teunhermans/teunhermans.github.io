# 👋 Hi, I’m Teun

Welcome to my GitHub page!

I’m a graduating Data Science student, and over the past few years I've worked on a variety of projects — from optimization and AI to reinforcement learning and graph databases. Below are a few highlights of my work.

## 🛠️ Selected Projects

- **[Group Project – Golfing Maze AI](https://github.com/TessaDerks/Putting-group_09)**  
  Built a golf simulator, one game mode creates a maze environment. An AI agent based on a genetic algorithm can be used to solve the maze.

- **[Poker Knowledge Graphs](https://github.com/teunhermans/Poker_KG)**  
  Modeled two datasets about played poker games in a knowledge graph. Information can be retrieved from this KG by SQL queries, some are already provided.

- **[Bachelor Thesis – Integrality Gap Exploration](https://github.com/teunhermans/Thesis-code)**  
  Did an experimental study on the integrality gap, the ratio between the relaxation and the actual value of the optimization problem. The project is in Python, made heavy use of the library "Gurobi".

- **Agents in a MountainCar Environment**  
  Compared various agents in the classic RL MountainCar environment.

- **Q-Learning on Blackjack**  
  Learned optimal Blackjack strategy via Q-learning.

- **Multi-Agent Learning in Connect-Four**  
  Agents learning by competing in Connect-Four.
