# 👋 Hi, I'm Teun

Welcome to my GitHub page!

I’m a graduating Data Science student, and over the past few years I've worked on a variety of projects — from optimization and AI to reinforcement learning and graph databases. Below are a few highlights of my work.

## 🛠️ Selected Projects

- **[Group Project – Golfing Maze AI](https://github.com/TessaDerks/Putting-group_09)**  
  As a group, we built a golf simulator with a twist: a maze environment and an AI agent that learns to navigate it. This was one of the most fun projects I’ve worked on — we used a genetic algorithm to evolve the agent’s behavior.

- **[Poker Knowledge Graphs](https://github.com/teunhermans/Poker_KG)**  
  Built a knowledge graph to model poker rules and strategies using two datasets. Queried using SQL and explored inference in graph structures.

- **[Bachelor Thesis – Integrality Gap Exploration](https://github.com/teunhermans/Thesis-code)**  
  For my thesis, I explored the *integrality gap* — a key concept in optimization — by experimenting with linear relaxations using Python and Gurobi.

## 🧠 Reinforcement Learning Projects

A few smaller projects to get hands-on with reinforcement learning techniques:

- **Agents in a MountainCar Environment**  
  Compared different agents in the classic `MountainCar` gym environment.

- **Q-Learning on Blackjack**  
  Implemented a Q-learning agent to learn optimal Blackjack strategy.

- **Multi-Agent Learning in Connect-Four**  
  Trained agents playing against each other in Connect-Four to explore competitive multi-agent learning.
